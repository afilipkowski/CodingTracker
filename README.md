## Tech stack
- C#
- Dapper
- [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console)
- SQLite

## Features
- The app uses SQLite database to store data.
- The user can record their coding session by inserting date and time of start and end of the session. The app takes care of calculating the duration and total coding time as well as average coding time per session.
- The user can delete and update existing records.
- The user can type “now” instead of the date to use the current date, so the app can be used as a timer for an ongoing session.
